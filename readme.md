# *main.py*
original file, works

eg: 
python main.py https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/mass-effect-expanded-soundtrack


# *run.py*
new version, also works
uses vgmdl.py as downloader and parser, by default fully threaded with 4 workers

eg: 
pyton run.py https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/mass-effect-expanded-soundtrack

# *gui.py*
work in progress for giving a console based ui to the tool
would like to integrate downloader.py from the rich examples

# *vgmdllib.py*
new version of vgmdl, with better queue management and possibility to interrupt the downloads queue

# TODO
# add small text file with original URL
# download album picture
